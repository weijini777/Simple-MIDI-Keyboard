# Simple Keyboard

A simple, lightweight MIDI synthesizer app. Users can pick from four different sounds and four different tracks to record onto, and save the resulting performance as a MIDI file. Keys can be played using the mouse, or the keyboard, changing octaves by pressing the up and down arrow keys. 

## Playback and Recording
Select the track to record onto by clicking the buttons. The box for the track should turn green, indicating that it is ready to record. Pressing the record button will clear the selected track and start playback of the other tracks, and the selected track will turn red to indicate that it is being recorded onto. Pressing the stop button will stop recording and save the track being recorded onto. Tracks with recorded data will have blue boxes. When one or more track has recorded data, pressing the play button will play the recorded data back, and the pause button will pause playback. Pressing the beginning button returns playback to the beginning of the recording. 

## Changing Instruments
Click the instrument button to show the instrument options, which are limited to a piano sound, a guitar, a violin, and a synthesizer. This will change the sound of the currently selected track without changing the instrument of the other tracks. 

## Saving a Recording
To save a recording, type the name of the file into the text field in the top left of the window, and click save. This will save the MIDI sequence as a MIDI file with the extension .mid. This file can then be used in other applications with more advanced synthesis abilities, without needing their heavier weight in the composition/sketching phase.
